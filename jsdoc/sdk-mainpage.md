The <strong>Vircadia Web SDK</strong> is a JavaScript SDK for developing web-based clients for virtual worlds powered by
Vircadia. Vircadia domain servers provide the worlds (a.k.a. "domains") to visit, and the Vircadia metaverse server provides
global services that connect the users and domains.
See the user docs to [Understand the Architecture](https://docs.vircadia.dev/explore/get-started/architecture.html).

This SDK provides interfaces to:
- Connect to domains.
- Use metaverse services.
