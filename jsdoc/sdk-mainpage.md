The <strong>Vircadia Web SDK</strong> is a JavaScript SDK for developing web-based clients for virtual worlds powered by 
Vircadia. Vircadia servers provide the worlds (a.k.a. "domains") to visit and the global metaverse services that connect the 
users and worlds.
See the user docs to [Understand the Architecture](https://docs.vircadia.dev/explore/get-started/architecture.html).

This SDK provides interfaces to:
- Connect to domains.
- Use metaverse services.
